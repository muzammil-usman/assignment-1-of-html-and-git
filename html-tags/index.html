    <p>At its core, WordPress is the simplest, most popular way to create your own website or blog. In fact,
         WordPress powers over 42.7% of all the websites on the Internet. Yes more than one in four websites that you visit are
          likely powered b WordPress.</p>

    <span>On a slightly more technical level, WordPress is an open-source content management system licensed under GPLv2, which means that
        can use or modify the WordPress software for free. A content management system is basically a tool that makes
         it easy to manage important aspects of your website – like content – without needing to know anything about programming.</span>

    <div>The end result is that WordPress makes building a website accessible to anyone – even people who aren’t developers.</div>

    <strong>What Kinds Of Websites Can WordPress Make?</strong>

    <p>Many years ago, WordPress was primarily a tool to create a blog, rather than more traditional websites. Tha
         t hasn’t been true for a long time, <hr> Nowadays, thanks to changes to the core code, as well as WordPress’ massi
         ve ecosystem of plugins and themes, you can create any type of website with WordPress.</p>


    <small>But suffice it to say, WordPress has pushed forward and, 
                    thanks to its contributors and huge community, developed into the most popular solution to create any type of website.</small></main>

            WordPress.org, often called self-hosted WordPress, is the free, open-source WordPress
         software that you can install on your own web host to create a website that’s 100% your own.
        WordPress.com is a for-profit, paid service that is powered by the WordPress.org software. It’s
         simple to use, but you lose much of the flexibility of the self-hosted WordPress.
